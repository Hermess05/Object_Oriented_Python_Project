# SIMPLE GAME
This project is a console-based game built in pure Python, designed to strengthen my object-oriented programming skills. The game focuses on creating classes, defining their relationships, and applying OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism. I implemented features such as abilities, races, and enemies as classes, providing a solid foundation for interactive gameplay. The goal was to improve my understanding of Python and class design, and the project serves as a practical example of my programming skills in object-oriented design.
